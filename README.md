# alias
This engine is an attempt to focus all of my engine development efforts into one place.

complete (not yet polished):
- Entity Component System/Query library
- internal scripting system (ash)
- C preprocessor library optionally used for other components
- 2D transform

in progress:
- single pass UI
- 2D physics
- 3d projective geometric algebra
- input library (in a cave)

future:
- 3D transform
- libuv threadpool work (partially in a cave)
- rendering (partially in a cave)

notes:
- use ash to implement ECS command buffer
- move a cave things to alias
